# Python Script for Simulating Event Production and Publishing to Azure Event Hub

This document describes a Python script designed simulates the production of events from 10 devices and publishes them to an Azure Event Hub.

## Required Modules

The script begins by importing necessary modules to simulate the production of events for 10 devices, and subsequently, publish them to an Azure Event Hub.

## Essential Modules

The script begins by which include `time`, `os`, `uuid`, `datetime`, `random`, and `json`. It also imports `EventHubProducerClient` and `EventData` from the `azure.eventhub` module.

## Function Definition

The function `simulate_event_production()` is created to simulate the production of events. This function initiates by generating a list of 10 unique device IDs using the `uuid` module.

An instance of `EventHubProducerClient` is then importing the necessary modules, these include: `time`, `os`, `uuid`, `datetime`, `random`, and `json`. It also requires `EventHubProducerClient` and `EventData` instantiated using a connection string and the name of the event hub. This client is utilized to produce and publish events to the Azure Event Hub.

## Event Production

The script enters a loop that runs 20 times. During each iteration, it establishes a new batch of events using the `create_batch()` method of the producer client from the `azure.eventhub` module.

## Function: simulate_event_production()

This function is used to simulate the production of events. Inside this function. For every device, a dummy reading is created which is a dictionary containing the device ID, the current timestamp, and random values for UV, temperature, and humidity. This dictionary is then transformed into a JSON string using the `json.dumps()` function.

The JSON string is encapsulated in an `, a list of 10 unique device IDs is generated with the help of the `uuid` module.

An instance of `EventHubProducerClient` is then created using aEventData` object and appended to the event data batch. Once all devices have been processed, the batch of events is dispatched to the event hub using the `send_batch()` method connection string and the name of the event hub. This client is tasked with producing and publishing the events to the Azure Event Hub.

## Event Production Loop of the producer client.

## Closing the Client

After all events have been produced and dispatched, the producer client is closed using the `close()` method. The function `simulate_event_production()` is then invoked to execute the simulation.
